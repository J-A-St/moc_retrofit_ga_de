## Description
   
   This algorithm is developed to solf the heat exchanger network retrofit problem for processes with multiple operating cases. Thecustomized two-level algorithm consists of a genetic algorithm for the topology optimization of the network and a differential evolution for the heat load optimization.

## Requirements
The algorithm requires Python 3.8. The following python modules are used:
- pandas 1.0.3
- xlrd 1.2.0 (newer versions do not support xlsx files)
- numpy 1.18.1
- scipy 1.5.0
- deap 1.3.1
## Data input
Case study data and algorithm parameter are stored in excel spreadsheets under data. Two examples for case studies (Zweifel.xlsx and JonesP3.xlsx) as well as a algorithm parameter file (AlgorithmParameter) is provided.
